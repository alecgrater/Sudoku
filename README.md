# Sudoku
Sudoku auto-solver via recursion and backtracking algorithm

## Prerequisites
Using [Sudoku Package](https://pypi.org/project/py-sudoku/) to generate a new board

To install, run:
`pip3 install py-sudoku`

# Sudoku
From root directory, run:
`python3 main.py`

# Gui (under development)

Two goals with this project:
1. create an intractable interface for the user to attempt to solve sudoku puzzles
2. visualize backtracking algorithm in real time.
